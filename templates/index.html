            <p>Skin care is at the interface of cosmetics and dermatology. 
              Skin care differs from dermatology by its inclusion of non-physician 
              professionals, such as estheticians and nursing staff. 
              Skin care includes modifications of individual behavior and of 
              environmental and working conditions.
              Skin care is an essential part of wound healing, radiation therapy, 
              and the management of some medications.</p>
